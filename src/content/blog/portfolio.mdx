I'm a naturalist. I multitask, running several activities at once. Hyperfocus is my middle name!

Personal resilience and professional growth.

**Bachelor's degree with a Teaching Credential in Biology**

My academic journey began with a Bachelor's in Biology at the University of São Paulo [USP](https://www5.usp.br/english/institutional/), the top public university in Brazil and the largest in Latin America. This degree laid a solid foundation for my future studies and research. 

Most importantly, the Biosciences Institute buildings are the most pleasant places on the entire campus of Sao Paulo, nestled in a small but idyllic piece of rainforest. At the beginning of my studies, I was drawn to Oceanography. Gradually, I developed an interest in neuro-things. As a result, I wrote my dissertation on the anatomy of nerves from a shark species. Formaldehyde made me cleaver!

**Master's degree in Psychology in Neuroscience and Behavior from USP**

After that, I joined an interdisciplinary neuroscience program and obtained my Master’s degree. I worked and studied across various campus institutes: Engineering, Psychology, Biomedicine, Biology, and Veterinary. I developed my skills in stereotaxic surgery, beginning with neuroanatomical tract tracers and concluding with brain injections and animal behavior. Despite gaining valuable experience and deepening my understanding of neurosciences, I became extremely anxious about working with animal models.


>Hard work, perseverance, and a deep passion for both teaching and learning

**Being a high school teacher**

Everyone should have an experience in teaching; it’s a life-changing experience. I had mine for 15 years. Brazil is not the best country to be a researcher, especially if you come from a humble family. In such a case, you must work outside the academy to balance real-life demands. Being a Biology teacher taught me how to manage a classroom with 40 adolescents (yes, this may be the number of students per class). It also taught me how to be deeply organized to meet all the demands a work like this imposes. I never had a weekly workload inferior to 35 hours. Despite the challenges, I could finish my undergraduate studies and conduct high-quality research in parallel. Experimentation was done on weekends and in a few free spots in the week, as well as literature research and attending courses. I kept this routine from the end of my undergraduate studies until halfway through my doctorate, when I decided to focus entirely on research. From those days, I feel a profound gratitude to all my students. They taught me a whole world: balancing a firm attitude with kindness and accepting and dealing with profoundly different people—all my love for education.

As if that weren't enough, I dedicated myself to German language studies, obtaining a **scholarship from [DAAD](https://www.daad.de/de/) to study in Freiburg/Germany**. This was another fantastic experience. 

**Doctorate in Sciences**

I began my doctorate journey deeply motivated to understand my student's brains better. I dealt with learning difficulties daily, which became my primary motivation to pursue my studies. I joined the Department of Psychiatry at the Federal University of São Paulo [UNIFESP](https://portal.unifesp.br/), where an excellent opportunity waved to me: using neuroimaging in a large children’s cohort to understand learning disorders better. Switching from basic research to a medical department took me a while. The language of science gained another perspective; an entirely different approach was in front of me. Talking with doctors differs from talking with naturalists; clinical research is an entirely different universe. It requires new studies: ethical protocols applied to human studies, health care, public health care, and different models for statistical analyses, among many other things. Importantly, communicating with a psychiatrist is very different from communicating with a radiologist or a neurologist. It was fascinating, but sometimes I felt frustrated. I was a square peg in a round hole! Even the hospital environment was somehow hostile to me.

We need time to adapt, that’s all. Little by little, I became comfortable working with doctors, psychologists, neuropsychologists, speech specialists, and occupational therapists—I hope I did not forget anyone—and I started to enjoy it. 

Neuroimaging became a passion. Diffusion brain images offered a crucial opportunity to keep my focus on the white matter (remember: shark nerves and neuro tracers are all dedicated to the white matter investigation). I specialized in structural resonances of the brain, following the most extensive children’s cohort of psychiatry in Brazil. 

**Being a researcher demands many skills**

Project management and people management

From the beginning of the National Institute of Developmental Psychiatry [INPD](https://inpd.org.br/) project, I was enrolled as a collaborator. This project investigates early clinical and neuroimaging findings of different mental disorders. I participated in the meetings to decide how to collect brain images and desensitize children to the noisy environment of the MRI scanner. My school teacher skills were deeply appreciated, and I was in charge of many responsibilities, including managing acquisition staff (psychologists, technical nurses, biomedical engineers) and supervising the acquisition protocol at the MRI console. Of course, I didn’t work alone; the team was well-tuned.  I was also responsible for putting the children (with the biomedical engineer’s supervision) in the scan. I was there not only to ensure protocol quality but to hold their hands, to make sure they were comfortable, and to make clear they could rely on me if any problem popped out. After all, my school days as a teacher were not so far. A total of 850 children between 6 and 14 years old were scanned, half in Sao Paulo and the other half in the South of Brazil. It was a monumental work, and around 10000 children were screened for mental health disorders at schools. Definitely, this work made me grow as a researcher. As the brain images were obtained in the MRI of the clinical facilities of a hospital, the challenges in managing acquisitions were even bigger. After all, we weren’t in a research-dedicated environment but in the facilities of a referral hospital, the largest in Latin America (Hospital das Clínicas de São Paulo). Fortunately, MRI scans were obtained on Sundays, so despite my hard week’s work as an ordinary teacher, I had the pleasure of being one of the coordinators of this task force. Again, children (and parents) made the difference. 


Neuroimaging and statistical analysis

Obtaining images was not easy, nor was the aftermath. 

I was in charge of organizing the neuroimaging datasets. This involved developing basic skills in Linux programming to install neuroimaging platforms for brain analysis. Gaining experience analyzing images is not trivial. It requires too much effort for someone not from programming, for a naturalist! Although I had some help installing software, I faced a completely different scenario when I worked as an **academic visitor at King’s College in London**. The IT guy was real; things worked smoothly. Again, researching Brazil is being between a rock and a hard place.

Diffusion images were acquired with many problems, and I was unhappy. This type of image is very prone to artifacts, and (believe me) we had all of them. This led me to a doctorate-bad trip. Despair was at the door. We tried to get the help of a mathematician who was an expert in diffusion images to access the K-space and correct them. 

I was a naturalist school teacher accessing the K-space!! This partially explains why I attended the physics MR imaging course twice. Briefly, K-space is a kind of "recipe" or map that tells the MRI how to create the final image.

Other dataset constraints were also present, so finally, I made the wise decision to exclude all non-reliable images from the dataset. Then, I faced a new challenge: an analysis of learning disorders was out of the table. 

When my first paper draft was written, I arrived in London with a promise that an expert in brain image analysis could help me use the **FSL platform**, a complex brain image software suite. To my surprise, I was that “expert”. Then, I had the first profound critical analysis of the paper draft. Although thoughtless, I appreciated the frank opinion about the poor and immature work I had. From there, I pivoted my analysis to come out with a real PhD. In another rough chapter, I worked daily, squeezing out a new direction for me. Fortunately, I came across the right people. Who helped me with two crucial things: advanced statistical analysis to overcome image limitations and physics expertise to allow me to implement my innovative ideas of white matter analysis. 

Sadly, during this period, my father’s illness was haunting me, and my worst nightmare happened: he passed away. I went to the funeral. And I don’t go deeper because tears always come to my eyes. This is only to remind us that a scientist is more than a guy or girl in a white lab coat.

Back in London, I had my grief and my new Everest: **advanced statistical analysis and Bayesian analysis**.

Things are what they are. I returned to Brazil and finished my Ph.D., and I became extremely anxious about working with some people. From then on, anxiety became a real problem that I still manage fiercely. Living abroad, mental health therapies, swimming, and painting are my allies.
