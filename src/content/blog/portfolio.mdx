"I'm a multitasking marvel, running several activities at once. Hyperfocus is my middle name!"

My academic journey began with a *Bachelor's degree in Biology* from the prestigious University of São Paulo (USP), which is the top public university in Brazil and the largest in Latin America. This degree laid a solid foundation for my future studies and research. You might not be familiar with [USP](https://www5.usp.br/english/institutional/), which is the top public university in Brazil and the largest in Latin America. Most importantly, the Biosciences Institute buildings are the most pleasant places on the entire campus of Sao Paulo, nestled in a small but idyllic piece of rainforest. At the beginning of my studies, I was drawn to Oceanography. Gradually, I developed an interest in neuro-things. As a result, I wrote my dissertation on shark nerves, and formaldehyde made me cleaver.

After that, I joined an interdisciplinary neuroscience program in which I obtained my *Master's degree in Psychology in Neuroscience and Behavior from USP*. I worked and studied across various campus institutes: Engineering, Psychology, Biomedicine, Biology, and Veterinary. I developed my skills in stereotaxic surgery, beginning with neuroanatomical tract tracers and concluding with brain injections and animal behavior. Despite gaining valuable experience and deepening my understanding of neurosciences, I became extremely anxious about working with animal models.


and a doctorate in Sciences from the Department of Psychiatry at the Federal University of São Paulo. During my doctorate I had an exchange period at the Institute of Psychiatry at King's College of London (CAPES scholarship). My PhD research was dedicated to the investigation of the neurodevelopment through diffusion images. From 2011 to 2020 I was a collaborator of The National Institute of Developmental Psychiatry, which is dedicated to the investigation of early clinical and neuroimaging findings of different mental disorders. After my PhD, I became postdoctoral researcher: first at the Center for Mathematics, Computation and Cognition at the Federal University of ABC and after at the Neurostimulation Laboratory, Clinical Division of the Department of Neurology at the USP School of Medicine, with a scholarship from the National Institute of Health (NIH). During two years I collaborated with the postgraduate program in Clinical Radiology at the Department of Diagnostic Imaging - Unifesp, becoming a collaborator professor and advisor for 6 months. In my postdoctoral projects I went through different brain imaging modalities and brain diseases. Recently, I became visiting researcher and principal investigator of the ZIKV group at Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein. This group was a part of federal grant named PROADI-MARIA aiming at the use of (Medical Approach Research in Imaging and Algorithms) to deepening the understanding of the Congenital Zika Syndrome through real world data (including neuroimaging) and machine learning algorithms. During this time I was in charge of advising students, preparing the project of investigation of the Congenital Zika Syndrome through real-world images, collaborating with the data analytics team, contacting the cohorts and writing scientific articles.
