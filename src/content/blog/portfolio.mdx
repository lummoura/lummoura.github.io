Yes, I'm a piece of work running multiple activities in parallel. Hiperfocus is my surname.


Bio
I have a Bachelor's degree in Biology from the University of São Paulo (USP)
Perhaps you don't know it, [USP](https://www5.usp.br/english/institutional/) is the top public university in Brazil, and the biggest in the Latin America. But the most important, the Biosciences Institute buildings are the most pleasent place to be in the Campus. A preserved piece of forest in the city of Sao Paulo. At the beggining of my studies I had a clear inclination to Oceanography. Gradually, I developed a taste for neuro-things. So I had my dissertation on shark nerves.




I have a Master's degree in Psychology in the area of Neuroscience and Behavior from USP 
During my graduation I developed 

and a doctorate in Sciences from the Department of Psychiatry at the Federal University of São Paulo. During my doctorate I had an exchange period at the Institute of Psychiatry at King's College of London (CAPES scholarship). My PhD research was dedicated to the investigation of the neurodevelopment through diffusion images. From 2011 to 2020 I was a collaborator of The National Institute of Developmental Psychiatry, which is dedicated to the investigation of early clinical and neuroimaging findings of different mental disorders. After my PhD, I became postdoctoral researcher: first at the Center for Mathematics, Computation and Cognition at the Federal University of ABC and after at the Neurostimulation Laboratory, Clinical Division of the Department of Neurology at the USP School of Medicine, with a scholarship from the National Institute of Health (NIH). During two years I collaborated with the postgraduate program in Clinical Radiology at the Department of Diagnostic Imaging - Unifesp, becoming a collaborator professor and advisor for 6 months. In my postdoctoral projects I went through different brain imaging modalities and brain diseases. Recently, I became visiting researcher and principal investigator of the ZIKV group at Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein. This group was a part of federal grant named PROADI-MARIA aiming at the use of (Medical Approach Research in Imaging and Algorithms) to deepening the understanding of the Congenital Zika Syndrome through real world data (including neuroimaging) and machine learning algorithms. During this time I was in charge of advising students, preparing the project of investigation of the Congenital Zika Syndrome through real-world images, collaborating with the data analytics team, contacting the cohorts and writing scientific articles.
