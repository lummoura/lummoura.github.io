# From Academic Rigor to Industry Impact: My Transition Story

You are not alone. I transitioned from academia to an industry-like setting through one of life’s mysterious opportunities. I was invited to join a research group, and everything felt different: the environment, the lack of windows in the big data, the people, and the meetings. It was a completely different flow. Fortunately, my boss, who had already adapted to the environment, was also a researcher. Speaking with someone who understood the ordinary aspirations of a research career made it much more straightforward than talking to someone who felt like they were speaking a different language.

## Navigating a New World

Navigating this new environment requires a learning curve; this transition isn’t always straightforward. You risk getting lost in translation without a proper introduction—I certainly did. What the hell is a PMO? Why do people speak about this role with such reverence? Understanding these new dynamics is crucial for an “old dog,” a former academic postdoc like myself.
Adapting to Agile: Tech Settings Work in Sprints

One of the biggest challenges was adapting to Agile methodology, frequently used in software development and tech settings. While I was familiar with long, marathon-like project timelines in academia, Agile demanded a different approach—rapid, iterative sprints. Fortunately, I was embraced by a supportive team that guided me through this new way of working. It reminded me of teaching: the unexpected will happen when you enter a classroom. No matter how organized you are or how clear the objectives are, you must adapt on the fly, just like in Agile sprints.

Learning to manage priorities quickly and communicate across teams was crucial in this environment, similar to working in a diverse classroom. Understanding people and situations was another layer of complexity. It’s not just about jargon; it’s about reading the dynamics and responding effectively—like learning the culture of a new country.


## Finding My Voice

My biggest challenge has been communicating my knowledge effectively. In academia, your work speaks through publications. Whether you’re a confident, eloquent scientist or a quieter, timid researcher, there’s space for everyone because publishing is the currency of success. Your publications serve as your professional credentials.
In industry, however, the emphasis shifts to how well you can pitch yourself and your ideas. For introverted scientists, this can be more challenging. It took me time to translate my expertise into concise pitches, and I’m still refining this skill.

I am not a shy geek researcher, but condensing my experience into a brief pitch—an abstract rather than a full article—still feels challenging. It’s hard not to feel like an impostor when you must present a surface-level summary instead of delving into the depth of your work. Even now, interviews remain challenging—not just due to timing and terminology differences but because pitching myself succinctly still feels unnatural.

## The Balance Between Expertise and Confidence

There are many types of scientists, but two typical profiles stand out: those who thrive on questioning and doubt and those who project confidence. The first type, doubt-driven scientists, are fast-paced learners who clearly articulate the limitations of knowledge and processes. They expose gaps and seek continuous learning, often highlighting the need for further research.

The second type—ego-driven scientists—might project confidence and knowledge beyond their expertise, making them effective at pitching themselves.

Finding a balance between the two is crucial for success in the industry—the ability to be a fast-paced learner while demonstrating confidence is a powerful combination. I lean toward the first type, but I’m actively working on finding that balance and building a compelling narrative that aligns with industry standards.

I’ve learned that combining academic rigor and industry adaptability is valuable and, ultimately, impactful. I’m excited to continue refining these skills to drive real-world results.
