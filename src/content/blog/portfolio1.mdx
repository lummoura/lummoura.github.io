Hi there, I'm Luciana! 
<br/>


<Image src="../../assets/images/foto_blog.jpg" alt="fotoLuciana" width="30%"/>

I’m a researcher passionate about making complex research subjects understandable and impactful. My journey has taken me from Biology to Neuroscience, from managing neuroimaging studies in large cohorts in Brazil to leading AI-driven diagnostic projects in a top hospital.

These days, I work as a freelance researcher, collaborating with brilliant scientists, doctors, and data experts to bring groundbreaking research to life. I’m all about using real-world evidence and cutting-edge AI to make healthcare smarter, more accessible, and more effective. I've been fortunate enough to live and work in Brazil and the UK, and now I call France home. I love being close enough to Paris for its vibrant culture and just a stone's throw from the countryside for long, peaceful walks in the forest.

Outside of work, I’m always diving into anything neuroscience-related that sparks my curiosity. When I’m not geeking out on the latest research, you can find me swimming or bringing scenes to life through watercolor painting.
