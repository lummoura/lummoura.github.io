# Are You a Good Follower?

Let’s talk about followership—because leadership is the absolute hit on the corporate radio. Everywhere you tune in, there’s another article about how to lead and stand out in a grove of “mediocre minds.” Somewhere along the way, leadership became a synonym for success. And honestly, it makes sense. In our selfish society—what I like to call the Black Mirror society (shoutout to the Netflix series)—it’s all about staying in the spotlight.

I deliberately chose “follower” instead of “collaborator” to reflect the broader spectrum of roles within a group. While collaboration assumes active, engaged participation and a committed, supportive partner who complements leadership, “follower” is an umbrella term that includes everyone on the team, the proactive contributors, and those who disengage or exploit the system, the counterproductive fellows. Recognizing this full range helps us address the strengths and challenges within team dynamics.

In a culture where consumerism defines status, everyone’s expected to lead to be validated. Collaboration? It’s often treated as a secondary, “cheap” product, overshadowed by the obsession with taking center stage.
But thankfully, not everyone aspires to lead. And that’s something worth celebrating! Cheers! Many people thrive working backstage, and their contributions as followers are just as vital as those of leaders. 

## Servant Leadership and Followership in Nature
Did you know followership is more about cooperation and grooming than coercion or punishment? I came across an engaging article on the origins and evolution of leadership (Current Biology, DOI: 10.1016/j.cub.2009.07.027), which describes fascinating patterns in the wild. For instance, fish with less energy reserves naturally step up as leaders, guiding foraging efforts. These fish lead by maintaining more distance from the group, subtly influencing its direction. Meanwhile, shy fish instinctively take on the role of followers, enhancing group success through their feedback. Bold leaders inspire trust, and shy followers amplify leadership effectiveness.

Leadership and followership emerge dynamically, and both are essential for group survival. The servant leader acknowledges the importance of collaboration and mutual accountability. Trust is the cornerstone of this harmonic interaction. Open communication and honest feedback are the absolute hits on this radio.
Attention: Blind loyalty has no place!

Here, followership is a “paradigm-based strategy” similar to scientific methods. You operate within the existing framework while being alert and prepared to question and enhance it. Exceptional followers offer accurate, reflective insights, using their expertise to guide the servant leader effectively. Similarly, effective leaders stay receptive to feedback; otherwise, they may fall when faced with giant waves. Questioning is not about rebellion but critical thinking that strengthens the team’s success.

## Manipulators, when Servant Leadership Fails
But what happens when fraudulent leaders take the wheel? Let’s not be naive: bad leaders are often clever manipulators skilled at self-promotion. They create toxic environments, suppress dissent, and retaliate against critical followers. In these cases, followership isn’t about “grooming” and must shift to protection and integrity. Stepping out should be healthier since institutions rarely support their followers. While work is essential, nothing surpasses your mental health. Unlike bees or ants, human group success should never come at the cost of individual well-being—mental health, fair pay, and personal integrity matter. 

## Nasty Free-Riders, when Followership Fails
Some individuals go beyond a simple free ride, pretending to be engaged. They actively work against the group’s goals. These disguised haters fake support for leadership while pursuing their agendas, subtly undermining the team. Think of the coworker who nods along in meetings but sabotages decisions behind the scenes. Usually, the main aim is to become a manipulator leader. Disguised haters in a team setting are more pervasive than free riders. Because they fail to contribute and create a toxic undercurrent that erodes trust and collaboration. A declared hater is easier to deal with.

## Changing the Focus from Leadership Courses
Unfortunately, while leadership courses flood the market, only some focus on teaching people to be exceptional copilots. The best copilot isn’t just an aspiring pilot but someone who supports the leader without competing for control. This principle is often overlooked, leaving followers undervalued in many organizations. At the core of successful leadership and followership lies communication. Educating both sides seems to be reasonable for reaching equity within organizations.

## Recognize the Value of Followership
Followership is not about playing second fiddle—it’s about making an impact through support, insight, and adaptability. The best followers are patient and ethical. They refine their skills, waiting for the right moment to lead if necessary. They climb their mountain without tearing others down.
So, instead of chasing the spotlight, ask yourself: Am I a good follower? After all, outstanding leadership depends on great followership. Sometimes, the most potent way to succeed is to sharpen and strengthen the leader while staying ready to step up when the time is right. And only if this is your desire.
