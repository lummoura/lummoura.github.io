#### An Accessible Guide Through Scientific Endeavor

### Hi! I'm Luciana, medical and scientific writer, with a background in Biology and a Ph.D. in Neuroscience. 



 > “For centuries, science has been under a line of attack that, rather than pseudoscience, can be called antiscience.”– Carl Sagan, 1995.

False beliefs repeatedly attributed to science motivated me to write these pages. Essentially, I take my lemons and make life take them back! Chill out as I invite you to share my Margarita during a barbecue catch-up, or, if you prefer, let’s grab a coffee together. I bring years of experience in my luggage, listening to random conversations on crowded buses, weddings, funerals, classrooms, lab benches, and conferences.

But I must warn you that this conversation is full of inconveniences—the same ones that make the stuff of science. Interestingly, these inconveniences are science’s driving force, pushing us to create incredible things. The impotence of doubt is one such inconvenience. Science demands perseverance to assemble a giant puzzle with an entirely unknown landscape. Accepting that we live in doubts rather than certainties is an arduous learning process. It’s the opposite of "antiscience," which is always rooted in astonishing omniscience.

###### Beyond the White Lab Coat
I do not come here to glamorize the process of doing science or to reinforce the belief in a white-coat lab scientist devoid of personal interest and life. Scientists stand in line at the bank, vote, eat fast food, and squeeze on the metro. Ms. Science is closer to a middle-class lady; forget the aristocratic English lady sipping tea at five o'clock. She is a libertarian, entrepreneurial, adventurous, grumpy, and methodical worker who efficiently handles her diverse offspring.

###### My journee into Science
I am the first scientist in a large family, and science became my passion and profession thanks to science popularization. As a child, I spent weekends watching the amazing deep-sea dives of Jacques Cousteau. I traveled the Milky Way and reached the farthest points on Earth, hitching a ride with the Cosmos series presented by Carl Sagan, the most outstanding science communicator ever. Fortunately, I was captivated by many others: Fernando Reinach, Marcelo Gleiser (Brazilian scientists), Stephen Jay Gould, Oliver Sacks, and Edward O. Wilson—one of the greatest biologists of our time—who recently passed away.

I had a strong inclination towards science. Edward O. Wilson wrote in The Creation: An Appeal to Save Life on Earth (2006): “The ascent to nature begins in childhood, and the science of biology is therefore ideally introduced in the earliest years. Every child is a beginning explorer, naturalist.” No one is born a scientist. We are born hungry and motivated; only good food will nurture a science newbie well.

Like many other children, I repeatedly watched cartoons and both good and bad TV shows. My references included Woody Woodpecker, Bugs Bunny, teachers, and scientists. Even though I was born into a humble family, I had the most important thing: room to desire and dream. That made all the difference.



- Type some Markdown on the left
- See HTML in the right
- ✨Magic ✨

## Features

- Import a HTML file and watch it magically convert to Markdown
- Drag and drop images (requires your Dropbox account be linked)
- Import and save files from GitHub, Dropbox, Google Drive and One Drive
- Drag and drop markdown and HTML files into Dillinger
- Export documents as Markdown, HTML and PDF

Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions
that people naturally use in email.
As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site][df1]

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's
> formatting syntax is to make it as readable
> as possible. The idea is that a
> Markdown-formatted document should be
> publishable as-is, as plain text, without
> looking like it's been marked up with tags
> or formatting instructions.

This text you see here is *actually- written in Markdown! To get a feel
for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and
watch the results in the right.

## Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [AngularJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
- [Ace Editor] - awesome web-based text editor
- [markdown-it] - Markdown parser done right. Fast and easy to extend.
- [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
- [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
- [Express] - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
- [Gulp] - the streaming build system
- [Breakdance](https://breakdance.github.io/breakdance/) - HTML
to Markdown converter
- [jQuery] - duh

And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.

## Installation

Dillinger requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v10+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
cd dillinger
npm i
node app
```

For production environments...

```sh
npm install --production
NODE_ENV=production node app
```

## Plugins

Dillinger is currently extended with the following plugins.
Instructions on how to use them in your own application are linked below.

| Plugin | README |
| ------ | ------ |
| Dropbox | [plugins/dropbox/README.md][PlDb] |
| GitHub | [plugins/github/README.md][PlGh] |
| Google Drive | [plugins/googledrive/README.md][PlGd] |
| OneDrive | [plugins/onedrive/README.md][PlOd] |
| Medium | [plugins/medium/README.md][PlMe] |
| Google Analytics | [plugins/googleanalytics/README.md][PlGa] |

## Development

Want to contribute? Great!

Dillinger uses Gulp + Webpack for fast developing.
Make a change in your file and instantaneously see your updates!

Open your favorite Terminal and run these commands.

First Tab:

```sh
node app
```

Second Tab:

```sh
gulp watch
```

(optional) Third:

```sh
karma test
```

#### Building for source

For production release:

```sh
gulp build --prod
```

Generating pre-built zip archives for distribution:

```sh
gulp build dist --prod
```

## Docker

Dillinger is very easy to install and deploy in a Docker container.

By default, the Docker will expose port 8080, so change this within the
Dockerfile if necessary. When ready, simply use the Dockerfile to
build the image.

```sh
cd dillinger
docker build -t <youruser>/dillinger:${package.json.version} .
```

This will create the dillinger image and pull in the necessary dependencies.
Be sure to swap out `${package.json.version}` with the actual
version of Dillinger.

Once done, run the Docker image and map the port to whatever you wish on
your host. In this example, we simply map port 8000 of the host to
port 8080 of the Docker (or whatever port was exposed in the Dockerfile):

```sh
docker run -d -p 8000:8080 --restart=always --cap-add=SYS_ADMIN --name=dillinger <youruser>/dillinger:${package.json.version}
```

> Note: `--capt-add=SYS-ADMIN` is required for PDF rendering.

Verify the deployment by navigating to your server address in
your preferred browser.

```sh
127.0.0.1:8000
```

**If you know HTML, yes i know ou already know enough to write your first Astro component.**

Astro component syntax is a superset of HTML. The syntax was [designed to feel familiar to anyone with experience writing HTML or JSX](#differences-between-astro-and-jsx), and adds support for including components and JavaScript expressions.

## JSX-like Expressions

You can define local JavaScript variables inside of the frontmatter component script between the two code fences (`---`) of an Astro component. You can then inject these variables into the component's HTML template using JSX-like expressions!

\:::note\[dynamic vs reactive]
Using this approach, you can include **dynamic** values that are calculated in the frontmatter. But once included, these values are not **reactive** and will never change. Astro components are templates that only run once, during the rendering step.

See below for more examples of [differences between Astro and JSX](#differences-between-astro-and-jsx).
\:::

### Variables

Local variables can be added into the HTML using the curly braces syntax:

```astro
---
const name = 'Astro'
---

<div>
	<h1>Hello {name}!</h1>
	<!-- Outputs <h1>Hello Astro!</h1> -->
</div>
```

### Dynamic Attributes

Local variables can be used in curly braces to pass attribute values to both HTML elements and components:

```astro
---
const name = 'Astro'
---

<h1 class={name}>Attribute expressions are supported</h1>

<MyComponent templateLiteralNameAttribute={`MyNameIs${name}`} />
```

\:::caution
HTML attributes will be converted to strings, so it is not possible to pass functions and objects to HTML elements.
For example, you can't assign an event handler to an HTML element in an Astro component:

```astro
---
// dont-do-this.astro
function handleClick() {
	console.log('button clicked!')
}
---

<!-- ❌ This doesn't work! ❌ -->
<button onClick={handleClick}>Nothing will happen when you click me!</button>
```

Instead, use a client-side script to add the event handler, like you would in vanilla JavaScript:

```astro
---
// do-this-instead.astro
---

<button id='button'>Click Me</button>
<script>
	function handleClick() {
		console.log('button clicked!')
	}
	document.getElementById('button').addEventListener('click', handleClick)
</script>
```

\:::

### Dynamic HTML

Local variables can be used in JSX-like functions to produce dynamically-generated HTML elements:

```astro
---
const items = ['Dog', 'Cat', 'Platypus']
---

<ul>
	{items.map((item) => <li>{item}</li>)}
</ul>
```

Astro can conditionally display HTML using JSX logical operators and ternary expressions.

```astro
---
const visible = true
---

{visible && <p>Show me!</p>}

{visible ? <p>Show me!</p> : <p>Else show me!</p>}
```

### Dynamic Tags

You can also use dynamic tags by setting a variable to an HTML tag name or a component import:

```astro
---
import MyComponent from './MyComponent.astro'
const Element = 'div'
const Component = MyComponent
---

<Element>Hello!</Element>
<!-- renders as <div>Hello!</div> -->
<Component />
<!-- renders as <MyComponent /> -->
```

When using dynamic tags:

* **Variable names must be capitalized.** For example, use `Element`, not `element`. Otherwise, Astro will try to render your variable name as a literal HTML tag.
* **Hydration directives are not supported.** When using [`client:*` hydration directives](/en/core-concepts/framework-components/#hydrating-interactive-components), Astro needs to know which components to bundle for production, and the dynamic tag pattern prevents this from working.

### Fragments

Astro supports using either `<Fragment> </Fragment>` or the shorthand `<> </>`.

Fragments can be useful to avoid wrapper elements when adding [`set:*` directives](/en/reference/directives-reference/#sethtml), as in the following example:

```astro
---
const htmlString = '<p>Raw HTML content</p>'
---

<Fragment set:html={htmlString} />
```

### Differences between Astro and JSX

Astro component syntax is a superset of HTML. It was designed to feel familiar to anyone with HTML or JSX experience, but there are a couple of key differences between `.astro` files and JSX.

#### Attributes

In Astro, you use the standard `kebab-case` format for all HTML attributes instead of the `camelCase` used in JSX. This even works for `class`, which is not supported by React.

```jsx
<div className="box" dataValue="3" />
<div class="box" data-value="3" />
```

#### Multiple Elements

An Astro component template can render multiple elements with no need to wrap everything in a single `<div>` or `<>`, unlike JavaScript or JSX.

```astro
---
// Template with multiple elements
---

<p>No need to wrap elements in a single containing element.</p>
<p>Astro supports multiple root elements in a template.</p>
```

#### Comments

In Astro, you can use standard HTML comments or JavaScript-style comments.

```astro
---

---

<!-- HTML comment syntax is valid in .astro files -->{/* JS comment syntax is also valid */}
```

\:::caution
HTML-style comments will be included in browser DOM, while JS ones will be skipped. To leave TODO messages or other development-only explanations, you may wish to use JavaScript-style comments instead.
