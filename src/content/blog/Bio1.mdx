I'm a naturalist. I multitask, running several activities at once. Hyperfocus is my middle name!


**Bachelor's degree with a Teaching Credential in Biology**

My academic journey began with a Bachelor's in Biology at the University of São Paulo [USP](https://www5.usp.br/english/institutional/), the top public university in Brazil and the largest in Latin America. This degree laid a solid foundation for my future studies and research. 

Most importantly, the Biosciences Institute buildings are the most pleasant places on the entire campus of Sao Paulo, nestled in a small but idyllic piece of rainforest. At the beginning of my studies, I was drawn to Oceanography. Gradually, I developed an interest in neuro-things. As a result, I wrote my dissertation on the anatomy of nerves from a shark species. Formaldehyde made me cleaver!



**Master's degree in Psychology in Neuroscience and Behavior from USP**

After that, I joined an interdisciplinary neuroscience program and obtained my Master’s degree. I worked and studied across various campus institutes: Engineering, Psychology, Biomedicine, Biology, and Veterinary. I developed my skills in stereotaxic surgery, beginning with neuroanatomical tract tracers and concluding with brain injections and animal behavior. Despite gaining valuable experience and deepening my understanding of neurosciences, I became extremely anxious about working with animal models.
