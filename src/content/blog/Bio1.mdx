I’m a Naturalist
Evolution and Neuroscience are my favorite topics in Biology. Although my academic journey has taken me down various fascinating paths, these two subjects have always been at the heart of my curiosity and research.
 
**Bachelor's Degree with a Teaching Credential in Biology**
My academic journey began with a Bachelor's in Biology at the University of São Paulo [USP](https://www5.usp.br/), the top public university in Brazil and the largest in Latin America. This degree laid a strong foundation for my future studies and research. One of the most pleasant memories I have from that time is studying at the Biosciences Institute, surrounded by a small but beautiful patch of rainforest—an inspiring setting for a biologist!
Initially, I was drawn to oceanography and fascinated by marine life. But as my studies progressed, I found myself gravitating toward neuroscience—something about the complexity of the brain intrigued me. My dissertation focused on the anatomy of shark nerves, blending my early interest in marine biology with my emerging passion for neuroanatomy. I like to joke that working with formaldehyde during that research made me sharper!
 
**Master’s Degree in Psychology, Neuroscience, and Behavior**

After my Bachelor’s, I joined an interdisciplinary neuroscience program at USP, where I earned a Master’s degree in Neuroscience and Behavior. This program was unique because it connected me to multiple fields—Engineering, Psychology, Biomedicine, Biology, and even Veterinary Science. I gained valuable experience working across different departments, learning to approach the brain from many angles.
During my Master’s, I developed key technical skills, such as stereotaxic surgery—a method for precisely targeting areas in the brain. I started working with neuroanatomical tracers to map brain pathways and progressed to performing brain injections and studying animal behavior. These experiences led to [my first scientific publication](https://www.scielo.br/j/bjmbr/a/FHJxWGsKsSKCMMrjzHpggsC/?format=pdf&lang=en), a milestone that marked the beginning of my academic research career.
However, despite the rewarding scientific discoveries, I grew anxious about working with animal models. Though I learned a lot, I realized I prefer to keep animals as pets, not subjects! Finishing my Master’s required me to be profoundly resilient.

**Life as a High School Teacher**
Just when I was fully immersed in research, life had a surprise for me—it pulled me into the world of teaching, a chapter that turned out to be deeply rewarding.
Teaching high school students is something everyone should experience. It’s life-changing. For me, it lasted 15 years. In Brazil, especially for those from humble beginnings, balancing academic aspirations with real-life responsibilities is a necessity. I had to work outside academia to meet those demands, and teaching biology became my way to do that.
Managing classrooms filled with 40 adolescents (yes, 40!) taught me a lot—organization, patience, and creativity were critical to surviving a weekly workload of more than 35 hours. Teaching Botany was never part of my original plan, but I grew to love it. Imagine explaining plant reproduction to a room of teenagers—talk about a test in patience and improvisation! It turned out to be an incredible experience that taught me how to communicate complex ideas in ways that were engaging and understandable to students.

Despite the intensity of teaching, I never gave up on my research. I conducted experiments on weekends, fit in with the literature review during free moments, and continued attending courses. This hectic schedule lasted through the end of my undergraduate studies and into the first half of my doctorate.

In hindsight, my students were my most outstanding teachers. They showed me how to balance authority with kindness and interact with people from all walks of life. Teaching shaped my resilience and adaptability, and I am deeply grateful for that experience.
 
**Going International: Studying in Germany**

To expand my horizons, I took on another challenge: learning German. My dedication to this led to a scholarship from [DAAD](https://www.daad.de/de/), allowing me to study in Freiburg, Germany. Living abroad was a transformative experience—it opened me up to new perspectives and cultures, feeding my natural curiosity for exploration. I now have a strong interest in diving into new cultural adventures.
 
**Achievements in Soft Skills**
* Active listening
* Adaptability
* Conflict resolution
* Emotional intelligence
* Multitasking
* Planning
* Empathy
* Teaching
 
**Non-Objective Achievements**
Of course, not everything can be measured by skills alone. Some of my proudest moments as a teacher came from the hugs, smiles, and even surprise birthday parties my students threw for me. These moments remind me that education is about more than knowledge—it's about connection.
