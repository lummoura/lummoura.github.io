I'm a naturalist. Evolution and Neuroscience are my preferred subjects in Biology.

**Bachelor's degree with a Teaching Credential in Biology**

My academic journey began with a Bachelor's in Biology at the University of São Paulo [USP](https://www5.usp.br/english/institutional/), the top public university in Brazil and the largest in Latin America. This degree laid a solid foundation for my future studies and research.
Most importantly, the Biosciences Institute buildings are the most pleasant places on the entire campus of Sao Paulo, nestled in a small but idyllic piece of rainforest. At the beginning of my studies, I was drawn to Oceanography. Gradually, I developed an interest in neuro-things.
As a result, I wrote my dissertation on the anatomy of nerves from a shark species. Formaldehyde made me cleaver!

**Master's degree in Psychology in Neuroscience and Behavior from USP**

After that, I joined an interdisciplinary neuroscience program and obtained my Master’s degree. I worked and studied across various campus institutes: Engineering, Psychology, Biomedicine, Biology, and Veterinary.
I developed my skills in stereotaxic surgery (a technique for precisely targeting specific brain areas), beginning with neuroanatomical tract tracers and concluding with brain injections and animal behavior. This resulted in my first scientific article.
Despite gaining valuable experience and deepening my understanding of neurosciences, I became extremely anxious about working with animal models. I prefer them as pets.

If you prefer to measure experience objectively:

**Hard and Technical Skills**
* Brain anatomy
* Wistar rat manipulation
* Stereotaxic surgery
* Behavioral recording and analysis
* Transcardial perfusion
* Histological preparation and analysis
* Statistical analysis

**Soft Skills**
* Resilience
* Creativity
* Adaptability
* Problem-solving
* Creativity
* Stress and Time-management
* Attention to detail

>**While I was deep in research, life had other plans for me, pulling me into the teaching world, which became a rewarding chapter.**

**Being a high school teacher**

Everyone should have experience teaching teens.

It’s a life-changing experience. I had mine for 15 years. Brazil is not the best country to be a researcher, especially if you come from a humble family. In such a case, you must work outside the academy to balance real-life demands. Being a Biology teacher taught me how to manage a classroom with 40 adolescents (yes, this may be the number of students per class). It taught me how to be deeply organized to meet all the demands a work like this imposes. I never had a weekly workload of less than 35 hours in the classroom. Teaching Botany was never part of my life plan, but it was a beloved experience that taught me to be versatile. Imagine managing a class of 40 teenagers while explaining the wonders of plant reproduction—let’s just say it teaches you more about patience and creativity than any textbook!

Despite the challenges, I could finish my undergraduate studies and conduct high-quality research in parallel. Experimentation was done on weekends and in a few free spots in the week, as well as literature research and attending courses. 

I kept this routine from the end of my undergraduate studies until halfway through my doctorate, when I decided to focus entirely on research. From those days, I feel a profound gratitude to all my students. They taught me a whole world: balancing a firm attitude with kindness and accepting and dealing with profoundly different people—all my love for education.

In addition, I committed myself to studying the German language and was awarded a scholarship from [DAAD](https://www.daad.de/de/) to study in Freiburg, Germany. This was a fantastic experience; living abroad for a while made me more open to different cultures. I have a strong interest in new cultural adventures.
