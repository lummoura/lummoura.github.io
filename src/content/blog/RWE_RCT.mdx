# Evidence for all patients: bridging real-world data and randomized trials

In a world increasingly shaped by big data and AI, incorporating real-world evidence (RWE) is no longer optional, nor is sacrificing methodological rigor.
*AI models depend on massive, heterogeneous datasets only RWE infrastructures can provide.* The challenge we now face is regulation and interoperability, not data scarcity. Healthcare must evolve frameworks that guarantee credibility, transparency, and patient protection, while enabling data to flow seamlessly across systems in ways that genuinely support science and innovation.

Beyond its current role in post-marketing assessment, which complements causality by adding effectiveness and safety, **RWE should be systematically and prospectively integrated into randomized clinical trial (RCT) design** to address diseases where traditional trial structures are insufficient. By adding external validity, RWE enhances the generalisability of RCT findings. This integration is particularly valuable in complex, rare diseases and vulnerable populations, where the main challenges lie in limited data availability and the need to combine multiple data streams—from omics and imaging to clinical and broader real-world data sources.

## RWE captures contextual influences

This approach captures contextual and environmental influences crucial for understanding multifactorial diseases such as psychiatric and neurological disorders, but not limited to them. Devane et al. (2025) propose a five-domain strategy to integrate RCTs and RWE systematically: methodological design, data infrastructure, stakeholder collaboration, quality assurance, and regulatory alignment. Incorporating these dimensions is non-negotiable for advancing precision medicine, with innovation as the central pillar of this transition.

The integration of RCTs and RWE is therefore more than a methodological refinement. It is a necessary evolution to ensure that evidence reflects the diversity and complexity of real patients. By embedding innovation in trial designs within robust legal and regulatory frameworks, we can move beyond fragmented approaches and create a future where data, science, and practice converge to deliver truly evidence-based care for all.

I recommend two articles that provide an introduction to the understanding of RWE–RCT coupling:
